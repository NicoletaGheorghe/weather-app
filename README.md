# 7-Day Weather App

A sleek, responsive weather forecast app built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**, allowing users to search for weather in up to three different cities at once and view a detailed 7-day forecast powered by [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/).

## Features

* View 7-day weather forecasts for **up to three cities** simultaneously
* Three independent search bars for easy city selection
* Fully responsive UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile
* Live weather data via the Open-Meteo API
* Clean, modern design with TailwindCSS styling

---

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* **Styling:** [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **Data Source:** [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)
* **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## How it Works

1. The user types a city name into any of the three search bars.
2. The app fetches geolocation data for the city, then calls Open-Meteo's forecast API.
3. It then displays a 7-day weather forecast including temperature highs/lows, wind speed, and weather conditions.
4. Each column works independently, allowing comparison between locations in real time.
